# Dragoncon Past Guests

This is fan-based and not owned by Dragoncon.

I don't own anything, I just wanted a better way to search for past guests.

This program lets a user look at past guest data easier.
* A user can search for a given guest based on any part of their name.
* A user can also look for a guest in a given year.

Retreived from "http://www.dragoncon.org/?q=past_guests" 

Website sorts past guest list by [first name,last name,year of last appearance]

TODO: 
I haven't finished the program yet, but here's what I plan to do.
* print menu: guest name, year, or range of years
* print guest by last name or first name (e.g. only A last names, or only Z first names)
* open browser window to search for the given guests online
* let user search for guests in a given series (most difficult to implement)
